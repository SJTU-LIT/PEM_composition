"Just another case of our broken Criminal Justice system in Alaska!  

It used to be that a 'Felony' was a serious crime where the convicted was punished.  Not anymore, they are just put on probation and told to play nice and don't get caught again.  Which in this case, the Bethel complaint was a ""low-priority"" one and the result is a dead man and possibly his wife.

Yes, the Criminal Justice System is overloaded, understaffed and underfunded, we have heard that before.  Just like AST is understaffed and has to prioritize their resources based on ""priority"".  The big question is 'why'?

If the Legislature can remodel offices, buy buildings, take trips on state money, and make back room deals with boondoggles to nowhere, then perhaps their priorities are wrong?

When the Governor can take trips promoting business, spend obscene money on buddy attorneys and consultants while the people of the state deal with property crimes which are ""low-priority"",  perhaps the voters are just stupid!",0.8333333134651184,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8333333134651184,0.1666666716337204,0.0,test

What an absolutely stupid comment. The supply of lawyers is also dictated by off shore schools. Seeing that only1 in 11 students get into a Canadian Law school when they apply what happens to the ten? Well maybe 2 or 3 give up the rest go off shore. Bond University in Australia has a complete Canadian Law school and the other kids go to the United States or Britain - then they come back and the Canadian Federation of Law Societies lets them take catch up courses and bingo they write the Bar and are lawyers. Seeing that 1/3 of the students that wrote the Bar in Ontario last year received their education off shore that means the law societies do control the amount of lawyers.

Wyden asked Clapper: “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions, of Americans?” Clapper replied, untruthfully: “No sir,” rubbing his head. “Not wittingly.” ""

"Mr. Donovan:  I have several times suggested that in my layman's opinion, Mr. Trump is a sociopath.  I have referenced the definition of sociopath and the list of behaviors characterizing sociopathy.  

""Never trust a sociopath. He's a liar. He lies to get his way, he lies to hurt, and sometimes he lies just for his own amusement. A sociopath is extremely skilled at lying, so much so that it always seems as though he's telling the truth. As a pathological liar, a sociopath constantly makes up stories so captivating that people easily believe them."" source Healthy Place   I must say, Mr. Trump has lied all his life...his personal life, his business life, and, now of course, his political life.

Don't bother with the ""fake news"" drivel; Trump makes a fool of himself every time he says it: why would you join him? Describing the observations of Gen. Honore and Mayor Cruz as ""uninformed"" is preposterous, dishonest. 
Interesting that you cite Russia in your attempt to whitewash Trump's failure in Puerto Rico: as the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election unfolds, nothing good is happening for Trump or for his surrogates.

Much as - if you grab a woman and kiss her, that's usually sexual assault. If you stop a few centimeters away, and wait to see if you she comes in and kisses you back - then it is consensual.

Success:  While Trump critics decry his bankruptcies and business failures, he does still own a vast empire of hotels and has his name on many more, along with golf courses.  Trump's wealth is real.  O'Leary, on the other hand would be easily discredited as a phony ""rich guy"".  Trump wasn't stupid enough to launch a mutual fund company that has done little to make money.

There is NO WAY - repeat, there is NO WAY - to get house prices that high without external money flooding in. It is an IMPOSSIBILITY for local wages to get house prices to 24 times, to 30 times, to 36 times the average annual local income.
